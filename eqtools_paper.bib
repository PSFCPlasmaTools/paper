  abstract = {An efficient method is given to reconstruct the current profile parameters,
	the plasma shape, and a current profile consistent with the magnetohydrodynamic
	equilibrium constraint from external magnetic measurements, based
	on a Picard iteration approach which approximately conserves the
	measurements. Computational efforts are reduced by parametrizing
	the current profile linearly in terms of a number of physical parameters.
	Results of detailed comparative calculations and a sensitivity study
	are described. Illustrative calculations to reconstruct the current
	profiles and plasma shapes in ohmically and auxiliarily heated Doublet
	III plasmas are given which show many interesting features of the
	current profiles.},
