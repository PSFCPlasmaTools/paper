	the plasma shape, and a current profile consistent with the magnetohydrodynamic
	equilibrium constraint from external magnetic measurements, based
	on a Picard iteration approach which approximately conserves the
	measurements. Computational efforts are reduced by parametrizing
	the current profile linearly in terms of a number of physical parameters.
	Results of detailed comparative calculations and a sensitivity study
	are described. Illustrative calculations to reconstruct the current
	profiles and plasma shapes in ohmically and auxiliarily heated Doublet
	III plasmas are given which show many interesting features of the
	current profiles.},

@article{Lekien2005,
	Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to give a local tricubic interpolation scheme in three dimensions that is both C1 and isotropic. The algorithm is based on a specific 64 Ã— 64 matrix that gives the relationship between the derivatives at the corners of the elements and the coefficients of the tricubic interpolant for this element. In contrast with global interpolation where the interpolated function usually depends on the whole data set, our tricubic local interpolation only uses data in a neighbourhood of an element. We show that the resulting interpolated function and its three first derivatives are continuous if one uses cubic interpolants. The implementation of the interpolator can be downloaded as a static and dynamic library for most platforms. The major difference between this work and current local interpolation schemes is that we do not separate the problem into three one-dimensional problems. This allows for a much easier and accurate computation of higher derivatives of the extrapolated field. Applications to the computation of Lagrangian coherent structures in ocean data are briefly discussed.},

The difficulties of mixed language programming between Fortran and C are resolved in an almost compiler and platform independent way. We provide a polished software tool F2PY that can (semi-)automatically build interfaces between the Python and Fortran languages and hence almost completely hide the difficulties from the target user: a research scientist who develops a computer model using a high-performance scripting approach.},
